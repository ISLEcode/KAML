# KAML examples

-   User management profile

    The file [examples/doe-john.kml][staffdb] is a real life example. The [AIT] **staff** utility uses KAML files like this to
    manage a centralised database of users and groups, managing their per-server credentials, their IDs and photos, as well as
    their SSH and related keys.
